Created a feature to detect the number of females as well as males in a meeting room along with their age.
if the person wear a white shirt we should make their age as 23 irrespective of their age and gender as well if they wear black shirt we should predict that person as child irrespective of their age and gender and this feature should not work if we have less than 2 people in the meeting
